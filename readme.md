# Challenge 1
This is the first challenge, and it's going to be a very simple one. The code contains a template which you'll use to implement a ceaser cipher algorithm.

### How the algorithm works
> Ceasers cipher is one of the earliest and easy to implement cryptographic algorithm. The steps involved are highlighted below:
  - Step 0: Mathematically, map the letters to numbers (i.e., A = 1,
    B = 2, and so on).
  - Step 1: Select an integer key K in between 1 and 25 (i.e., there
    are total 26 letters in the English language).
  - Step 2: The encryption formula is “Add k mod 26”; that is, the
    original letter L becomes (L + k)%26.
  - Step 3: The deciphering is “Subtract k mod 26”; that is, the
    encrypted letter L becomes (L – k)%26.
